# Contributing

This project is licensed under GPL v3, see [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) for more details.         

All contributions are welcome, but must follow this guide.       

Please keep in mind that this is a side project, developed at night after often 10 hours of code during the day.   
A lot of things needs to be improved, and code reviews can take a long time.      


## Before starting 

Ensure that your idea is a need that will be shared by other people.       

Open an issue to discuss it and to avoid unnecessary or duplicate work.        

If not already done, please check the [backlog](documentation/5_backlog.md) too !


## Getting started üèÅ

Please read the contents of [documentation/](documentation/) folder before. Don't worry, it's a quick read. You will learn how to set up your workstation and to start 
Abc-Map locally.


## Before submitting code

- Try it, smarten it
- Test it
- Proofread it


## Submit your code

See [Forking Workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html).

In a nutshell:   
- Fork Abc-Map
- Create a branch, let the code genius speak
- Create a Merge Request, target this repo/master


## Master branch is production ready

All code merged in master must be production ready.      

In order to make this possible, all contributions must be carefully reviewed. A code review must include:    
- Meticulous proofreading and understanding of code 
- Manual tests of features 
- Automated test inspection     

Since no one is paid yet, code reviews take time.
