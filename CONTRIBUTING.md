## Before starting 

Ensure that your idea is a need that will be shared by other people. You can discuss it by opening an issue on 
the main repository.    

Please check the [backlog](documentation/5_backlog.md) too !


## Before submitting code

- Try it, smarten it
- Test it
- Proofread it


## Master branch is production ready

All code merged in master must be production ready.      

In order to make this possible, all contributions must be carefully reviewed. A code review must include:    
- Meticulous proofreading and understanding of code 
- Manual tests of features 
- Automated test inspection     

Since no one is paid yet, code reviews take time.
