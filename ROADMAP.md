# Roadmap

Where is this funny weird machine going ?

The next steps for this project are:

- ~~Creation of a better export system with rich text frames~~
- ~~Creation of shared maps~~
- Creation of better data processing modules: better data tables, and creation of geometries from spreadsheet data

And who knows what will happen next ?
