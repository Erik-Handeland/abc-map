## Purpose in a nutshell

Abc-Map is a tool for processing geographic information that is easy to understand and use.

Use cases:             

- Education
- Professional uses: tourism, deliveries, ...
- Sports and leisure: hiking, hunting, treasure hunts, ...

More information [here](https://abc-map.fr/documentation).    


## Why ?

There are some very good GIS available: [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) and others are great software. But they are 
designed by and for experts, and are hard to use. The goal of this project is to provide a light GIS experience 
without complex technical knowledge. 


## Status of project

Abc-Map 2 is at a very early stage. 

Everything is done within the means available to make this project a long-lasting one. But this software is developed 
at night after often 10 hours of code during the day.       

A lot of things needs to be - and will be - improved üí™
