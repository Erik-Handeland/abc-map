## Why ?

There are some very good GIS available: [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) and others are great software. But they are 
designed by and for experts, and are hard to use.  
 
Abc-Map is a lightweight GIS whose objective is to offer a good user experience for neophytes as for experts in a 
hurry.
