# End-to-end tests 

Tests here are separated in two groupes:    
- `src/integration/ci`: these tests pass in continuous integration
- `src/integration/others`: these tests does not pass in continuous integration


For the moment and despite several trials, some tests does not pass when using Cypress headless mode.
