# Create a map

In this section, you will discover the steps to create a map with Abc-Map:

1. Choose a basemap
2. Import data
3. Add and edit geometries
4. Apply data processing
5. Create a legend
6. Layout and export
7. Save or export project

All of these steps are optional.

## 1. Choose a basemap

On the map page, keep the default basemap, or choose a basemap by clicking on `Add a layer`.

You can use:

- Predefined layers (layers prepared and configured for easy use)
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service" target="_blank">WMS</a> layers
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service" target="_blank">WMTS</a> layers
- <a href="https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/">XYZ</a> layers

### Which layer to choose ?

First, try the `predefined layers`, they are the easiest to use.

If you do not find what you are looking for, use your favorite search engine to find an alternative. For example,
try searching for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=couche+wms+france&t=h_&ia=web" target="_blank">"wms layer france"</a>.
You will then need to complete the new layer form, usually with a URL and identifiers provided by the owner of the data.

## 2. Import data

You can import data in several ways:

- Using the `Data store`, which provides selected data (the catalog is being filled)
- By dropping files from your computer on the `Map` page
- By clicking on the data import control on the `Map` page, then by selecting files from your computer

## 3. Add and modify shapes

Use the drawing tools to create or modify geometry and their properties. The operation of
each tool is explained in its respective help.

</figure>

Keep in mind that:

- Drawing tools only work when a geometry layer is active
- Each tool only modifies its associated geometry type: the polygon tool only modifies polygons, the point tool
  only modifies the points, ...

## 4. Apply data processing

On the "Data processing" page, you can apply data processing. Treatments are explained on their corresponding pages.

## 5. Create a legend

On the "Layout" page, click "Edit legend".

Add a title and description for each shape used on your map.

**By default the caption is not displayed.** On the `Layout` page select position you want to display map legend.

## 6. Layout and export

On the "Layout" page, create one or more pages according to your needs. When your creation is ready export it in `PDF` or `PNG` format:

- The PDF format allows you to create a standalone document, usable on any computer or smartphone
- The PNG format allows you to integrate your map into a document, for example in a word processor

## 7. Save or export your project

Register to save your project online, it's free!

Or export your project to save it on your computer. You can re-import it later.
