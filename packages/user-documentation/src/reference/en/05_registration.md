# Registration, connection

You can register and connect to Abc-Map.

Registration is _optional_, it does not give access to more features, it only allows you to keep your projects online.

## Registration emails

To complete your registration you must click on a confirmation link sent by email.

If you do not receive a registration email, check the email address entered and then check your `SPAMs`.

If you don't receive anything, your email provider may be blocking this platform.
Create an <a href="https://gitlab.com/abc-map/abc-map/-/issues" target="_blank"> Issue </a> to describe your problem.
