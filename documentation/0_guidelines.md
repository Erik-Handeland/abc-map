## User comes first

This software is intended for end users. It is assumed that our users either do not have a lot of skills in 
the area, or do not have a lot of time to devote to the software. All functionality should be as easy to understand 
and use as possible.         

Privacy and security are primary concerns, and data collection must be justified by a technical need for security.   


## Then developer's turn

In order to promote quality developments, it is desirable to maintain a good development experience.      

Someone who does not know this project should be able to start it, to build it, and to hack it in few hours. Services 
(servers, frontend and databases) should start quickly, should not fail, and should display enough information to be 
understandable.  

The software code must be kept clear and understandable. It must be extensively tested to allow to develop it quickly 
and with confidence.
